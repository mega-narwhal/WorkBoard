# memory-benchmarks — WorkBoard vs memory systems

Benchmark suite comparing **WorkBoard** against AI-memory systems on token
efficiency. Lives under `dev/` so it's **git-ignored and never ships** (the
repo's designated home for "tests, sims, benchmarks"). Nothing here touches the
live product: each study reads a frozen `board_snapshot.json` and runs in a
sandboxed `$HOME`.

Each peer is its **own self-contained, independently-reproducible folder** — you
can run any one of them alone, or zip it and hand it to someone.

## Peers

| Study | Status | Headline (vs WorkBoard) |
|---|---|---|
| **[claude-mem/](claude-mem/)** | ✅ done (#730) | Bootstrap **98.6–99.2% fewer** ingest tokens; recall **25.9% fewer** (33% lifecycle); live **0 vs 546K** model tokens/100 sessions |
| **mem0** | ✅ done (#734) | Live loop **33.7% fewer** model tokens; recall vs full-context **−90.8%** (matches mem0's own "90%") |
| **letta** | ✅ done (#735) | **81.0% fewer** model tokens (92.2% trimmed); Letta's tax is per-*turn* (re-sent core blocks + tool schemas) |
| **graphify** | ⏳ deferred (#733) | — |

> Numbers from each study's own auto-generated reports. claude-mem/mem0/letta are
> measured/modeled per each study's `REPRODUCIBILITY` notes; settings favor the
> peer, so WorkBoard margins are conservative floors.

## Reproduce any study

```bash
cd dev/memory-benchmarks/<peer>
python3 run_bootstrap.py && python3 run_recall.py && python3 replay_session.py
# then the report generators (see that study's README)
```

## Conventions for a new peer study

1. Copy an existing peer folder as the template (keeps it self-contained).
2. Add `peers/<peer>_adapter.py` modeling that system from its **own published
   numbers** (so it can't be accused of sandbagging); set defaults to favor it.
3. Keep the **same tokenizer** (`tokencount.py`) and the **same frozen corpora +
   queries** — that's the cross-study fairness control.
4. Write a `PROCESS_LOG.md` (step-by-step) so a later session resumes without
   rerunning, and a `REPRODUCIBILITY.md` (per-number provenance).
