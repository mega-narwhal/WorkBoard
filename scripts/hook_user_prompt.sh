cat <<MSG
<board-steward-protocol>
A live work board tracks this project${server_hint}. The board is source of truth, not your memory.

LIVE lifecycle — keep the board in sync as you work, never batch to session end:
  - Starting a unit of work the user would reference later by # → \`card.py add --column task --title "<verb + noun>" --origin "<their words>"\` then \`card.py fly <n> inprogress\` the moment work begins.
  - Shipped / fixed / deferred / blocked something not yet reflected → \`card.py fly <n> done --writeup "<commits, files, verification>"\` (or \`blocked --note\`).
  - Pure question / explain / read-only / a conversational micro-turn → do nothing.
One update per unit. The user must NEVER have to ask "did you update the board?" — that question is a failure of this protocol.

Board: ${board_path:-(server-only)}  ·  Last card event: ${last_card_ts:-none recorded}
