# Output goes straight into Claude's context. Exit 0 always (non-blocking).
# Cost: <50ms in the common case.

cat <<MSG
<board-steward-protocol>
A live work board is tracking this project${server_hint}.

MANDATORY before responding:
  - If your IMMEDIATE prior assistant turn shipped / deployed / completed / fixed / deferred anything that isn't already on the board, run \`card.py add\` or \`card.py move\` NOW. Don't batch — one update per shipped unit.
  - If you only investigated or read, do nothing.

Why this hook exists: the user must NEVER have to ask "did you update the board?" — that question is a failure of this protocol.

Last card-added event: ${last_card_ts:-none recorded}
Board: ${board_path:-(server-only)}
