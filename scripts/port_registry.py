"""Shared port registry for board-steward.

A tiny JSON file at ~/.config/board-steward/port-registry.json maps each
running board's absolute path → {port, pid, started_at}. serve.py writes its
entry on boot; card.py + hooks consult it for O(1) port lookup instead of
probing 7891-7900 every CLI call.

The registry is advisory, not authoritative — readers MUST verify the entry
is alive (the /health-ping check is the consumer's job) before trusting it.
This keeps the file self-healing across crashes / SIGKILL / laptop sleep
without needing a daemon to scrub it.
