"""Stop-hook session-end reconciliation backstop (#279).

The live "never-miss on sign-off" guarantee. When the agent ends a session,
nothing else verifies that every substantive work-unit got carded or that
shipped In-Progress cards moved to Done — that was only ever advisory prose in
SKILL.md §F. This helper closes the gap.

Reads the Claude Code Stop-hook payload from stdin:
    {session_id, transcript_path, cwd, stop_hook_active, ...}

It is SELF-CONTAINED (no discover2/hourly_extractor imports) and reads ONLY the
session's own transcript (transcript_path) — so it's fast and can't hang on a
580-file glob. It detects:
  1. UNCARDED WORK — the session shows ship signals (git commit / "shipped" /
     "deployed") or many file edits, but no card.py add/move/fly ran this
     session → work likely went un-tracked.
  2. OPEN IN-PROGRESS — cards still in inprogress at sign-off (gentle reminder
     to confirm done or leave a note).

When something is found it writes board/recon_pending.json (the existing schema,
tagged source=stop_recon) so the NEXT SessionStart surfaces it and the next main
Claude reconciles with full context. Non-blocking, silent-fail, exit 0 always.
