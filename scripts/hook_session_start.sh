<board-steward-session-start>
WorkBoard is installed and this session started in your home directory. The user
has NOT created their first board yet. From their Claude session history, these
are the projects they've actually worked in (most substantial first; tab =
path<TAB>label):

${projects}

ACTION (do this now, don't wait to be asked): call AskUserQuestion to ask which
ONE project should get a WorkBoard. Make each listed project an option (label =
the project name, description = the "(ago, N sessions, N edits)" detail). Exactly
one board on first run — they can add more later by asking "open a new workboard
for <project>". If their project isn't listed, they can type its path.

When they pick a project at PATH, create + open the board by running:

  bash "${hook_dir}/bootstrap_project.sh" "PATH"

That assigns the project's port, mines its history into a one-by-one fly-in,
opens the browser, and marks onboarding done. Do NOT pick for them.

When you announce the board, use THIS exact shape — relay verbatim, don't pad:

1. One line: the board is live + its port (http://127.0.0.1:<port>).
2. The FLY_ESTIMATE: line from the script's output, verbatim (the calculated
   "estimated time to finish + recommended action" message — short and sweet).
3. Then this block, exactly as written:

You're all set. A few things to know:
- Add another board anytime — just say "open a new workboard for <project>".
- It remembers. Close the tab, come back tomorrow — your board picks up right where you left off.
- Just work normally. Say things like "shipped X", "fixed Y", or "what's left?" and the cards move themselves.

What would you like to work on?

If asked what happens when they work while cards fly: nothing breaks — the board
keeps a server lock so writes serialize — but new edits can interleave with the
backfill and muddle ordering, so it's cleaner to let the fill settle.
