"""hourly_extractor.py — bucket 1 hour at a time, LLM digest → cards.

Replaces the per-turn extraction model. For each 1-hour bucket of activity:
  1. Build a digest of all events in that hour (prompts, edits, commits, etc.)
  2. Call `claude -p` headlessly with a structured prompt
  3. LLM returns a JSON array of cards (work units, NOT per-turn cards)
  4. Emit each card via card.py with optional lifecycle flight

This is the "simulate the work as if a human was titling cards" model — one
card per discrete unit of work, with column routing inferred from signals
(commits → done, urgency phrases → mandatory, file edits → inprogress, etc.)

Stdlib only.

# ---------- LLM digest prompt ---------------------------------------------

_LLM_PROMPT = """\
You are extracting kanban cards from a block of work activity. The input below is a chronological log from one OR more time buckets.

Your job: identify the DISCRETE UNITS OF WORK that happened in each bucket. Each unit becomes ONE card. Group related turns (the user asked, then clarified, then you built it, then they reviewed) under ONE card — NOT one card per turn.

Output: a JSON ARRAY of card objects. Each card:
{
  "title": "verb + noun phrase, ≤70 chars. CLEAN — do NOT prefix with the code (the code renders as its own badge). Examples: 'Atomic-hop primitive for card moves', 'Fix card-drag freeze on iPhone', 'Investigate convo dedup'. NO conversational openers (btw, can u, oh wait). NO verbatim user wording — summarize the WORK.",
  "code": "short CAPS badge from the noun cluster, ≤24 chars (e.g. 'BOARD-FLY', 'DISCOVER2', 'SIM-60D'). Assign one ONLY when the work has a distinct, reusable NAMED subject — a feature, system, or named fix you'd reference again (roughly half of cards earn one). Leave it EMPTY for routine one-off fixes, chores, tweaks, investigations, or observations with no nameable subject. A code means 'this is a thing with a name', not 'something happened'.",
  "column": "one of: task | backlog | inprogress | done | mandatory | notes",
  "priority": "low | mid | critical",
  "origin": "WHY this work exists — the user's goal or the trigger, in their voice/intent (not yours). ≤200 chars. e.g. 'User wanted card-drag to work on iPhone where the columns stack vertically and the old handler froze.' This is the 'why this exists' a teammate reads to understand the card at a glance. Empty string only if genuinely unknowable.",
  "notes": "What the work actually was: problem → approach → outcome (or current state). 1-3 sentences, ≤300 chars. Concrete — name the file/function/command. If a COMMIT line (a sha) for this work appears in the bucket log, ALWAYS cite its short sha, e.g. 'Shipped in 7b565ff.' For UNFINISHED work, state what's left. Empty string only if no signal.",
  "tags": ["one or two from: feature | bug | fix | refactor | doc | design | discipline | infrastructure"]
}

Column routing rules:
- "done"       → a git commit landed in this hour OR a clean ship phrase appeared (shipped X / deployed / merged)
- "mandatory"  → user said urgent / must / impt / critical / asap / blocker / 'this is impt'
- "inprogress" → files were edited but no ship hit
- "task"       → mentioned, named, planned but no edits yet
- "backlog"    → deferred / open / undone: user said "later" / "next session" / "tomorrow" / "defer" / "pending" / "we'll revisit" / "nvm save it", OR the work was started but explicitly NOT finished
- "notes"      → captured observation / idea / decision, NOT a unit of work to ship

OPEN / DEFERRED work is the highest-value signal — surface it, don't bury it:
- If the work was deferred or left unfinished, route to "backlog" (or "task" if never started) AND begin notes with "⏸ OPEN — " followed by exactly what remains and the trigger to resume (e.g. "⏸ OPEN — sim_60d --strict still fails on the archive-on-install gap; resume to decide strict-cap policy.").
- Closure markers ("shipped" / "merged" / "done" / a commit sha) override deferral — those go to "done".

Quality bar:
- Skip conversational micro-turns ("yes", "ok", "stop", "open the board", "rerun"). They are NOT cards.
- One unit of work = one card. If the user asked about feature X, you built it, and they reviewed it — that is ONE card titled by what X is.
- If two units of work happened in the same hour, return two cards.
- origin = the user's WHY; notes = the WHAT/HOW/STATE. Keep them distinct, both concrete. Prefer real file/commit/command names over vague summaries.
- If nothing card-worthy happened, return [].

Return ONLY the JSON array. NO markdown, NO commentary, NO ```json fences.
