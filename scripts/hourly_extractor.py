"""hourly_extractor.py — bucket 1 hour at a time, LLM digest → cards.

Replaces the per-turn extraction model. For each 1-hour bucket of activity:
  1. Build a digest of all events in that hour (prompts, edits, commits, etc.)
  2. Call `claude -p` headlessly with a structured prompt
  3. LLM returns a JSON array of cards (work units, NOT per-turn cards)
  4. Emit each card via card.py with optional lifecycle flight

This is the "simulate the work as if a human was titling cards" model — one
card per discrete unit of work, with column routing inferred from signals
(commits → done, urgency phrases → mandatory, file edits → inprogress, etc.)

Stdlib only.

# harvests fresh exactly as before — so the long-lived serve.py process NEVER
# serves stale events to a later SessionStart --reconcile-only pass. The key is
