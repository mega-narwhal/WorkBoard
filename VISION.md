# VISION — `board-steward`

## Goal

Be **the #1 kanban board for Claude and the humans Claude works with.**

Not "a kanban that supports Claude." A kanban built _from the ground up_ around the reality that the agent and the human ship code together — fast — and the board is the only thing keeping both honest about what's done, what's in flight, and what got forgotten in a branch three levels deep.

## The problem this exists to solve

Work with Claude moves so fast that **tasks branch faster than humans can track them.**

A typical session:

```
Task 1.    Fix the auth bug.
   └─ 1.1  Migration breaks on Postgres 16
       └─ 1.1.1  Locking behavior changed in PG16
       └─ 1.1.2  Need to backfill the new column under load
   └─ 1.2  Session token format drift between staging/prod
Task 2.    Add the rate-limit header.
Task 3.    …
Task 4.    …
Task 5.    [forgotten — buried 3 levels deep in Task 1]
```

By the time Claude resolves `1.1.2`, **item 5 is gone.** The user re-asks for it three days later thinking it was missed; Claude apologizes and re-does discovery from scratch. Multiply by 30 sessions a week.

This is the failure mode every other kanban (Trello, Linear, Notion, Asana) is **structurally unable to solve**, because they assume a human types every card. The human typing is the bottleneck. By the time you've finished typing "fix locking behavior changed in PG16," you've forgotten task 5.

## The principle

> **Zero input from the user. Work auto-logs.**

- User says "I have an idea: …"  →  card appears in **Ideas**, animated in, in real time
- Claude starts implementing it    →  card slides to **In Progress**
- Claude hits a blocker            →  card slides to **Blocked** with the reason as the note
- Claude ships it                  →  card slides to **Done** with a multi-paragraph write-up of _how_ it was done (commit SHAs, files touched, verification)
- Claude branches mid-task         →  subtasks tree out _inside_ the card; the parent never leaves the screen

The user **glances at the board** — does not type, does not drag, does not configure — and knows the full state of the work. The board is a **living dashboard of the collaboration**, not a project-management tool that the human has to keep fed.

## What "the #1 kanban" means concretely

It wins on four axes — each axis the others ignore:

### 1. UI/UX maxed out

- **Live motion.** Cards pop in with overshoot easing (`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`) the instant they're created. Cards moving between columns animate with the FLIP technique — they _glide_ from one column to another, not teleport. Columns slide in. The user _sees_ the work flowing in real time, like a trading dashboard, not a database.
- **Glanceable, not clicky.** Origin (the "why this card exists") shown as a hover tooltip on the home view — no click required to understand any card. Time-since-update inline on the head row. Priority is a color stripe. Code badges (e.g. `FACT-F2`) for shared vocabulary.
- **The calendar tab is a real calendar** — not a list view in a grid skin. Each card lands on its done-day or created-day; the user can see "we shipped 17 things on May 25" at a glance.
- **No setup screens.** No "click here to open file." Open the URL, the board is there.

### 2. Token-efficient by design

Most agent tools fail here. They dump 100KB of state into the context window on every turn and call it "memory."

`board-steward` is the opposite:

- **Tiered reads.** SessionStart hook injects a **~150-token digest** (`🚨 SUPER URGENT: 3 · 📌 MANDATORY: 5 · Backlog: 37 · Done: 44 · Last shipped: #98 (<1h ago)`). The full board.json is _never_ loaded unless a specific card is referenced.
- **CLI primitives.** Claude queries the board via `card.py show <num>` or `card.py list --status doing` — subprocess returns sliced JSON, the agent never reads the 113KB file.
- **Progressive disclosure ladder.** Digest at boot → one card on demand → full thread only when truly necessary.
- **Index.json digest** (~34KB) regenerated atomically after every write, for the rare case the agent needs a sweeping view.

Target: **<2KB of context** consumed by the board on a typical session start, vs ~147KB for a naive design. Measured, not aspirational.

### 3. Startup is instant and invisible

- **Autostart.** macOS `launchd` plist (Linux: systemd unit, Windows: scheduled task) brings the local server up at boot. The user never starts anything. The URL `http://127.0.0.1:7891` just works.
- **Hook fallback.** If `launchd` ever dies, the `SessionStart` hook detects the dead port and re-spawns the server in the same turn. The user never sees a broken board.
- **Auto-bootstrap.** On first install, `discover.py` mines `~/.claude/projects/*/sessions/*.jsonl` to seed the board with cards inferred from prior chat history — so the user opens the board for the first time and **already sees their last week of work**, chronologically, animated in card-by-card. No empty-state to fill.
- **One command to install** in any project: `python serve.py --bootstrap`. No config file. No account. No cloud.

### 4. Minimal friction — Claude does everything

The hardest design constraint, and the one that separates this from every kanban that came before it:

- **Auto-card-creation.** When the user says "I have an idea: X," Claude detects intent and runs `card.py add` — a card pops up in Ideas in real time, animated in over 320ms. No "want me to add this?" prompt. No user typing.
- **Auto-promotion.** When Claude finishes the task, it runs `card.py move <num> done` with a writeup. Card glides to Done. Hooks fire on the user's next prompt to confirm — no out-of-band "are we good?" check needed.
- **Auto-discovery.** When Claude does work matching an open card's notes (e.g. edits a file referenced by an in-progress card), the hook surfaces the linkage so the card gets updated atomically with the code change.
- **Self-gating.** Dense-keyword skill description so Claude knows when to engage (`shipped`, `deployed`, `merged`, `done`, `blocked`) and when to skip (`debug this`, `explain X`, `refactor Y` — pure code questions that don't ship). No drift in either direction.
- **Self-telemetry.** Every Steward invocation logs a JSONL event (frequency, issues, read efficiency, bookend compliance) so the skill _measurably improves itself_ over time — the user runs `report.py --days 14` and sees what's broken.

## Non-goals

- **Not a multi-user team tool.** No accounts, no permissions, no real-time collab between humans. This is the agent-and-one-human board. Teams use Linear.
- **Not a cloud product.** Everything is local files + localhost HTTP. The user owns their data; no signup; no telemetry leaves the machine.
- **Not a project-management tool.** No Gantt charts, no resource allocation, no sprint planning. The board reflects the work, it doesn't direct it.

## Distribution

- Installed as a Claude Code **skill** (`~/.claude/skills/board-steward`), so it shows up in the available-skills list and triggers on the right user phrases automatically.
- Source-of-truth repo at `~/Desktop/WorkBoard/`, published as open source.
- `python serve.py --bootstrap` is the one command anyone runs to get going. No npm, no Docker, no Postgres — pure stdlib Python + a single HTML file.

## The test

A user installs `board-steward`, opens Claude in their project, and says: _"build me a login form."_

Within 5 seconds, three things happen with **zero user input**:

1. The kanban opens at `http://127.0.0.1:7891` in their default browser.
2. A card pops into **In Progress** titled "Login form" with the user's exact phrasing as the origin.
3. As Claude works, sub-cards branch out (route, form component, validation, tests), each animating in. When tests pass, the card glides to **Done** with the commit SHA and a one-paragraph writeup.

The user did not type a single thing into the kanban. They glanced at it once and knew the full state of the work.

**That is the bar.** Anything less is just another kanban.

## Operating rules (Claude reads this every session)

These are durable, project-level instructions. Claude follows them on every turn while working in this repo or anything under `~/Desktop/`.

### 🚨 RULE 0 — MANDATORY SESSION STARTUP (do this BEFORE anything else)

**On the very first turn of every session, before responding to the user's request, before any tool call other than Read, before acknowledging anything — read BOTH files:**

```
~/Desktop/conversation_history/conversation_raw_YYMMDD.md   ← TODAY  (local date)
~/Desktop/conversation_history/conversation_raw_YYMMDD.md   ← YESTERDAY (local date − 1)
```

Where `YYMMDD` is the local date (e.g. `260527` = 2026-05-27, `260526` = yesterday).

Rules for this step:

- **Not optional.** Do it even if the user's first message looks trivial ("hi", "thanks", "ok"). Skipping is the #1 cause of "we already discussed this" drift.
- **Not announced.** Do not ask "want me to read the history first?" — just read.
- **Not summarised away.** Read the raw files. Do not rely on MEMORY.md / digests / carry-forward bullets as a substitute — those are lossy.
- **Both files.** If today's file doesn't exist yet (first session of the day), read yesterday's + the day before. Never read just one.
- **Then proceed.** Acknowledge what you saw in one line ("Read. Today = X sessions, last shipped Y. Yesterday = Z."), then answer the user's actual request.

If you find yourself responding to a substantive prompt without having read these two files this session — **stop, read them, then continue.**

### Other rules

1. **Commit on every turn.** After any meaningful change (code, docs, plan, card movement that touches files), make an atomic commit. Don't batch. Push if a remote is configured. If a turn produced no file changes, no commit — but explicitly say so. User's standing rule from `feedback_commit_each_change`: "make it reflexive."

2. **Dump full raw conversation at session end.** Append to today's file in the same dir. Format per `~/Desktop/conversation_history/instructions.md`. Never summarize; never overwrite.

## Shorthand aliases (user vocab)

- **`ss`** → screenshot. Always lives in `~/Desktop/ss/`. When user says "see latest ss" / "in desktop/ss", read the newest file in that directory with the `Read` tool.
- **`wb`** → WorkBoard. The kanban skill repo at `~/Desktop/WorkBoard/`, served at `http://127.0.0.1:7892` (separate from the QuantifyMe board on `:7891`).
- **`qm`** → QuantifyMe. The trading product at `~/Desktop/QuantifyMe/HFTAgents/`, board served at `http://127.0.0.1:7891`.
